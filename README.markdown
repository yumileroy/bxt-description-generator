14:46 -!- Irssi: Starting query in deltaanime with Chiyachan  
14:46 <Chiyachan> First of all. This should be an application. How it works, I don't know.  
14:46 <Chiyachan> I give the program a root directory.  
14:46 <Chiyachan> It takes each individual directory from there and separates them mentally.  
14:47 <Chiyachan> It goes though each directory and works out the following:  
14:47 <Chiyachan> Codec. Bitrate. Artist. Album name. Tracklist.  
14:47 <Chiyachan> It uses the previous data to make a BxT reliable description in a style I can provide an image of.  
14:47 <Chiyachan> Does that make sense?  
14:48 <xiong_chiamiov> mmhmm  
14:48 <Chiyachan> Can you do it?  
14:48 <xiong_chiamiov> depends on if I can find something to pull id3 tags out of files  
14:48 <Chiyachan> It doesn't need to be flashy. But needs to be able to work.  
14:48 <xiong_chiamiov> although, I suppose, a certain amount could be inferred by file/directory structure, but...  
14:49 <xiong_chiamiov> I'll look around tonight and let you know whether it's possible or not  
14:49 <Chiyachan> Do you want to see the directory I need it for the most?  
14:49 <xiong_chiamiov> sure  
14:50 -Chiyachan(~fap@drool.lolifest.sakura)- DCC Send xiong.jpg (86.170.167.85)  
14:53 <Chiyachan> http://www.boxtorrents.com/torrent/129523/Gundam_SEED_DESTINY_-_Complete_Soundtracks_music.html  
14:53 <Chiyachan> Description it generates should look like this.  
14:53 <Chiyachan> But instead of making "scans" it should have a File info: "Scans: Yes/No"  
14:54 <Chiyachan> For CD1/CD2 - Should be put under a single album as two tracklists  
14:54 <Chiyachan> If I make sense. =\  
14:55 <xiong_chiamiov> yeah, I think so  
14:56 <Chiyachan> Well, if you're able to make it.  
14:56 <Chiyachan> Not only will I love you.  
14:56 <Chiyachan> Other people who make large OST torrents will love you.
